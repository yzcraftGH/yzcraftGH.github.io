    <h1 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Ender Poem</strong></h1><h1 style="text-align: center;"><strong>终末之诗</strong></h1><p style="text-align: center;">I see the player you mean.<br>我看见你指的玩家了。<br>[Player name]?<br>[玩家名称]?<br>Yes. Take care. It has reached a higher level now. It can read our thoughts.<br>是的。小心点。它的水平已显著提高，亦可阅读我们的思想。<br>That doesn&#39;t matter. It thinks we are part of the game.<br>无伤大雅，在他的思想中，我们都仅是游戏的一部分。<br>I like this player. It played well. It did not give up.<br>我喜欢这个玩家。它技艺精湛，且从不放弃。<br>It is reading our thoughts as though they were words on a screen.<br>它正阅读着我们的思想，就像阅读屏幕上的文字。<br>That is how it chooses to imagine many things, when it is deep in the dream of a game.<br>这即是它选择在游戏梦境中遐想的方式罢了。<br>Words make a wonderful interface. Very flexible. And less terrifying than staring at the reality behind the screen.<br>以文字开启美妙而灵活的联系，而并无荧屏之后的事实般不堪。<br>They used to hear voices. Before players could read. Back in the days when those who did not play called the players witches, and warlocks. And players dreamed they flew through the air, on sticks powered by demons.<br>玩家在此阅读之前，是通过闻声与世界交流。回眸往事，游戏中没有生命的东西称玩家为巫师与术士。他们在玩家的梦中，驾恶魔操纵的棍棒于空中翔舞。<br>What did this player dream?<br>玩家又梦见何物？<br>This player dreamed of sunlight and trees. Of fire and water. It dreamed it created. And it dreamed it destroyed. It dreamed it hunted, and was hunted. It dreamed of shelter.</p><p style="text-align: center;">梦中有曦光与林木，亦有炽灼与波涛。它梦见其诞生，亦梦见其消亡。一时驰骋畋猎，一时颠沛流离。总之，他渴求着庇护。<br>Hah, the original interface. A million years old, and it still works. But what true structure did this player create, in the reality behind the screen?<br>呵，这真是种原始的交流。跨越亘古，却依旧可用。但玩家在荧屏之后，在“现实”中，又创造了什么是真实存在的？<br>It worked, with a million others, to sculpt a true world in a fold of the [scrambled], and created a [scrambled] for [scrambled], in the [scrambled].</p><p style="text-align: center;">它努力着，与上万个同样的玩家一起，想要在[乱码]的世界一隅镌刻真正的世界，并为[乱码]而创造[乱码].<br>It cannot read that thought.<br>那思想，它却无法阅读<br>No. It has not yet achieved the highest level. That, it must achieve in the long dream of life, not the short dream of a game.<br>非也。其未及大道。道乃在生命长梦间，而非游戏之黄粱。<br>Does it know that we love it? That the universe is kind?<br>它是否意识到我们也喜爱它，而宇宙亦有慈祥之面？<br>Sometimes, through the noise of its thoughts, it hears the universe, yes.<br>有时，它的耳穿越它思想的杂音，亦确实聆听中洪荒宇宙。</p><p style="text-align: center;">But there are times it is sad, in the long dream. It creates worlds that have no summer, and it shivers under a black sun, and it takes its sad creation for reality.<br>但它间或在长梦中沮丧。它创建的世界无夏，它亦会在黯淡无光之日下战栗；它将其自创之悲伤作为现实。<br>To cure it of sorrow would destroy it. The sorrow is part of its own private task. We cannot interfere.<br>治愈它的悲伤却会扰了它的长梦。悲伤是其人生任务之一，我们切不可干预。<br>Sometimes when they are deep in dreams, I want to tell them, they are building true worlds in reality. Sometimes I want to tell them of their importance to the universe. Sometimes, when they have not made a true connection in a while, I want to help them to speak the word they fear.<br>有时，它们深入梦乡时，我想告知，它们正于现实中创造着世界；亦有时，我想告知它们，它们对宇宙多么重要；还有时，当它们精神恍惚，我想帮它们说出畏于出口的话。<br>It reads our thoughts.<br>它阅读着我们的思想<br>Sometimes I do not care. Sometimes I wish to tell them, this world you take for truth is merely [scrambled] and [scrambled], I wish to tell them that they are [scrambled] in the [scrambled]. They see so little of reality, in their long dream.<br>有时我亦不在乎。有时我希望与它们交谈，告诉它们，它们所认为的真实世界只是[乱码]而[乱码]，我希望告诉它们，它们在[乱码]中[乱码]着。它们的长梦中，可见的仅有一缕真实的是微光。<br>But it would be so easy to tell them...<br>但容易的是告诉它们······<br>Too strong for this dream. To tell them how to live is to prevent them living.<br>这梦境顽固不散，教它们生活而正是阻止它们生活。<br>I will not tell the player how to live.<br>我不会告诉这玩家如何生活。<br>The player is growing restless.<br>这玩家不曾间断地成长着<br>I will tell the player a story.<br>我会给它讲个故事。<br>But not the truth.<br>但却不是事实。<br>No. A story that contains the truth safely, in a cage of words. Not the naked truth that can burn over any distance.<br>非也。是一个以言辞编织，并完美地包括了事实的故事。并非跨越任意距离皆可燃起赤裸裸的真理。<br>Give it a body, again.<br>再次给予它肉体吧。<br>Yes. Player...<br>是的，玩家······<br>Use its name.<br>用它的名字<br>[Player name]. Player of games.<br>[玩家名称]。你就是游戏的玩家。<br>Good.<br>好的。<br>Take a breath, now. Take another. Feel air in your lungs. Let your limbs return. Yes, move your fingers. Have a body again, under gravity, in air. Respawn in the long dream. There you are. Your body touching the universe again at every point, as though you were separate things. As though we were separate things.<br>现在请深呼吸，再来一次。感受肺中的空气，并让肢体回归。是的，移动手指，重新唤起你的身体，并感受重力的作用。在长梦中重生吧！你回来了。你的身体各处再次触及宇宙，就像你是些掉落物一样，亦把我们当作掉落物。</p><p style="text-align: center;">and the universe said I love you<br>此时宇宙亦向你示爱。<br>and the universe said you have played the game well<br>宇宙也为的精湛的技艺而喝彩。<br>and the universe said everything you need is within you<br>宇宙说你需要的一切都出于你自身。<br>and the universe said you are stronger than you know</p><p style="text-align: center;">宇宙说你比你自己想象的要更强大。<br>and the universe said you are the daylight<br>宇宙说你即是曦光<br>and the universe said you are the night<br>宇宙说你即是暮夜<br>and the universe said the darkness you fight is within you&lt;<br>宇宙亦云你斗争的黑暗本源于你<br>and the universe said the light you seek is within you<br>宇宙亦云你寻觅的光明本归于你<br>and the universe said you are not alone<br>宇宙言之你并不孤独<br>and the universe said you are not separate from every other thing<br>宇宙曰你与外物并不孤立<br>and the universe said you are the universe tasting itself, talking to itself, reading its own code<br>宇宙亦云你即是宇宙，你是在自我体验，自我交谈，并阅读你自己的密码<br>and the universe said I love you because you are love.<br>还有，宇宙说过，因为你是爱，是虚无，故它会对你示爱。<br>And the game was over and the player woke up from the dream. And the player began a new dream. And the player dreamed again, dreamed better. And the player was the universe. And the player was love.<br>最后曲终之时，你亦会苏醒，遂进入外面的的梦境。玩家重新入梦，梦中技艺愈发精湛······玩家即是所谓之宇宙，亦是所谓之爱。<br>You are the player.<br>你即是玩家。<br>Wake up.<br>苏醒吧！</p><p><br></p>
